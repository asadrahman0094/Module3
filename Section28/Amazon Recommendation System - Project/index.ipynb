    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lab, we are going to use Amazon Product Co-purchase data to make Book Recommendations using Social Network Analysis Techniques. We shall make use of the concepts covered in this section towards centrality and clustering dynamics of a graph. In particular, we'll make use of the \"Island Method\" for networks analysis to split the huge graph into smaller islands for identifying similarity between books. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Read and manipulate graph data and get it ready for analysis\n",
    "* Apply Network Analysis and graph dynamics concepts to analyze complex networks\n",
    "* Build a recommendation system using the graph data for complex networks"

    "## Graph Based Recommendation Systems \n",
    "From purchase suggestions on e-commerce websites to content customization on multimedia platforms, recommendation systems happen to be more and more widespread among the web. Modern companies such as Facebook, Netflix, Amazon all develop their own, aiming to propose items or contents which are more personalized and relevant to their users.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that in graph data, information entities are stored as nodes, which are linked together by edges showing some sort of association between these entities. This allows to easily retrieve knowledge about mutual relationships between nodes. Therefore, graphs are useful to describe systems of strongly connected entities, such as social networks, pages on a website, co-operation of any kind between associated entities etc. This feature of graph processing can be used to build efficient Recommendation systems (also known as Recommender Systems).\n",

    "In this lab, we built a recommendation system using Graph analysis techniques that we covered in this section. This is a simple recommendation system and can be improved a lot by bringing in more data i.e. user reviews, categories of books and in some cases, some manual fine tuning to create custom edges promoting recommendations. We shall look at another technique called collaborative filtering later in the course where we shall try to expand upon this experiment. "
